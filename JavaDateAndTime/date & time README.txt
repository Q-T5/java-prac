JAVA DATE AND TIME
Java does not have a built in Date class. 
We can import the java.time package to work with dates and time.

Some of the classes included in the package are:
    LocalDate- represents a date(yyyy-MM-dd)
    LocalTime- represents a time(hh-mm-ss-ns)
    LocalDateTime- represents both a date and a time(yyyy-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss-ns)
    DateTimeFormatter- formatter for displaying and parsing date-time objects
