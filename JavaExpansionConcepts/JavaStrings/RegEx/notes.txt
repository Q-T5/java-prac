JAVA REGEX{REGULAR EXPRESSIONS- java.util.regex
Is an API to define a pattern for searching or manipulating strings.
It is used to define constraints on strings such as passwords and email vaidation.

JAVA REGEX API
It has 1 interface and 3 concrete classes
        -> MatchResult interface

        -> Matcher class
    Implements the MatchResult interface. It is a regex engine which is used to perform match operations on a
    character sequence.
    Here are some of its important methods:
        i) boolean matches()- test whether the regex matches the pattern
        ii) boolean find()- finds the next expression that matches the pattern
        iii) boolean find(int start)- finds the next expression that matches the pattern from the given start num
        iv) String group()- returns the matched subsequence
        v)int start()- returns the starting index of the matched subsequence
        vi)int end()- returns the ending index of the matched subsequence
        vii)int groupCount()- returns the total number of the matched subsequence

        -> Pattern class
    It is the compiled version of a regular expression. It is used to define a pattern for the regex engine.
    Here are some of its important methods:
        i)static Pattern compile(String regex)- compiles the given regex and returns the instance of the Pattern.
        ii)Matcher matcher(CharSequence input)- creates a matcher that matches the given input with the pattern.
        iii)static boolean matches(String regex, CharSequence input)- it works as the combination of compile and matcher methods. It compiles the regex and matches the given input with the pattern.
        iv)String[] split(CharSequence input)- splits the given input string around matches of the given pattern.
        v)String pattern()- returns the regex pattern

        -> PatternSyntaxException class
    It's an exception object that's thrown when the regex test encounters an issue (not necessarily returns a false)
